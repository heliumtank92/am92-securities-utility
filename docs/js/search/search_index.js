@am92/securities-utility\n\nInitialization\nThe initialization step downloads the security master (sec master) from the specified URL and applies optimizations to enhance the performance of subsequent functionalities. This step runs on the main thread, and the package internally manages the worker for parallel execution. You only need to include a dedicated TypeScript/JavaScript file in your index.html\n\n\nInstructions\n\nCreate a New File: \n Create a new TypeScript/JavaScript file (e.g., initializeSecMaster.ts) containing the initialization code.\n\ninitializeSecMaster.ts\nExample :import { initialize } from '@am92/securities-utility';\n\n\nconst SEC_MASTER_URL = process.env.SEC_MASTER_URL; // URL for downloading the sec master (can be environment-specific)\n\n// Initialize the sec master\ntry {\n  initialize(SEC_MASTER_URL)\n  console.log('Sec master initialization successful.');\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error('Sec master initialization failed:', error);\n}\nInclude the File in index.html\nAdd the following script tag to your index.html to include the file:\n\nExample :Notes:\n\nThe package automatically handles the use of a web worker for parallel execution, ensuring the main thread remains unblocked.\nEnsure the SEC_MASTER_URL environment variable is correctly configured for your deployment environment.\n\nThis streamlined approach keeps your application setup simple while leveraging the package's internal optimizations.\n\n\nContributors\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          Ankit Gandhi\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          Mehul Agarwal\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          Suyash Jadhav\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nLicense\n\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2024 Ankit Mehul Team Account\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
